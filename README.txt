This is my senior project

First install git and clone senior-project-application repository from kunakornT/senior-project-application

After clone our project use "npm install" in project directory

If there are any errors about version of react-native or expo

Run "expo upgrade" and "npm i -g expo-cli" for updating expo

Run application "npm start"
